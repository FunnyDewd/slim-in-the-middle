# A Middleman Template

This is a middlman template I use often for prototyping web applications. 

## What's inside?
It's as close to the default Middleman template as I could keep it, for familiarity sake, with these mods:

* [Slim Templates](www.slim-lang.com)
* [Susy Grid](susy.oddbird.net)
* [Solarized Color Palette](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
* [H5BP Mobile Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
